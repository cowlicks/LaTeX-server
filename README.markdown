# Purpose
To make some scripts that allow uploading LaTeX to a web server to be compiled. Then returned to the user. Eventually add support for LaTeX files that require external files by having everything uploaded as a *.tar or *.zip.

# Install
* Install all the latex packages on your web server. 
* put this directory somewhere on your web server then navigate to it in your browser. 

# Security 
Planned features which *need* to be implemented for this to be secure.
* Compile *.tex under chroot.
* Parse the uploaded *.tex for the write18 command (executes shell code).
* ???
